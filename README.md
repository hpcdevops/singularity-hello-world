# singularity-hello-world

Very basic sample container definition for building on
<a href="https://singularity-hub.org/">Singularity Hub</a>.

Container is configured on Singularity Hub to re-build on each commit to the
repository.

Information about the container can be found
<a href="https://singularity-hub.org/collections/293/">here</a>.

Pull the container directly with the following command...

```
