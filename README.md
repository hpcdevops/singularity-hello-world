# singularity-hello-world

Very basic sample container definition for building on <a href="https://singularity-hub.org/">Singularity Hub</a> (https://singularity-hub.org/) with re-build triggered on each push to the repository.

Information about the container collection can be found on Singularity Hub at https://www.singularity-hub.org/collections/1342

Pull the container directly with the following command...

```
% singularity pull shub://hpcdevops/singularity-hello-world:master
```
